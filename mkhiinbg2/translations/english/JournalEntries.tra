@100001 = ~A Goblin in the City

M'Khiin Grubdoubler, a goblin shaman, has joined my party. Goblins, however, do not get the best reception within cities. I suspect her presence will cause some alarm while we traverse throughout Athkatla.~

With M'Khiin leaving the party, her travels in Athkatla will no longer concern the party.~
