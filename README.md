# M'Khiin NPC for BG2EE. 
This mod adds M'Khiin Grubdoubler, the goblin companion of Siege of Dragonspear, to BG2EE as a joinable NPC.

## FAQ

### Q: Why does M'Khiin seem out of character?

A: Players have their own interpretations of canon characters. While I think she remains in-character, you may feel differently. I also don't claim to perfectly replicate her speech. If you have any suggestions for improvements, I'd be delighted to hear them / implement them (with thanks and credit). 

### Q: Any plans for TRA-ifying?

A: Not currently. However, if someone is interested in translating, feel free to reach out. 

### Q: The flesh is weak!

A: Even in death I serve the Omnissiah! :3

## CHANGELOG

* 20241024 - Nightly. Drop the BASE. Added Paperdoll, Animations & Soundset support. 
* 20241025 - Nightly. Added SoA NPC Banters. Fixed a few item issues. Added additional portrait option. 

## LICENSING
* M'Khiin's resources are pulled from the base Siege of Dragonspear game. I don't own any of it. 
* My part of the mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests or alter content. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. commentary to vanilla quests), crossmod is free real estate. You can contact me to co-write / co-code it. Or simply add the crossmod on your end without my involvement.
* M'Khiin isn't even my OC. She's a canon character I'm expanding on. Honestly -- go wild. Change the talks completely. Remove the PID. Add to the PID. Reword lines you don't like. Write your own, completely seperate M'Khiin BG2EE mod that's considerably better than mine. The sky's the limit.
